SMoreSLogger is a app that sends and receives text messages with the goal of logging information.

Examples:
- how'd you sleep?
- how are you feeling?
- what did you eat today?
- feed the cats

The goal is to have a full framework for sending messages at intervals (including random ones) and logging data into some format for later analysis.
